Industrial facilities that meet Toxics Release Inventory (TRI) Program reporting requirements submit their data 
to EPA using either the Reporting Form R or Form A. Each "Basic" data file contains the 100 most-requested 
data fields from the TRI reporting form, including the quantities of toxic chemicals released into the 
environment on site at facilities; the quantities transferred off site to other facilities; and summary data 
concerning releases, recycling, energy recovery and treatment.
